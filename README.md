# AchievementBorder
Expand your world with achievements!

## Overview
Welcome to AchievementBorder! This plugin will start your world with a one-block border, and you can expand that border by completing achievements!

## Compatibility
You can enjoy the fun of a tiny world alone, or with friends! This plugin works on singleplayer and multiplayer servers!

**NOTE**: This plugin is **not** compatible with custom advancements provided by data packs. This is a limitation on Paper's end, 
and while a workaround is possible, it is very long and complicated, and this project is being done on my own time.
| |Compatible?|
| - | ----------- |
| Singleplayer | ✔ (requires Paper-compatible server) |
| Multiplayer | ✔ (requires Paper-compatible server) |
| Custom data packs | ❌ |

## Installation
Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/sh0ckR6/AchievementBorder/releases) and download the latest version of the plugin.
Install the plugin like you would any other plugin by dragging it into your server's `plugins` folder.

## Custom Recipes
This plugin adds custom recipes to the game so that the game is completable.
###### End stone recipe

###### End portal frame recipe

Without these recipes, the game would not be completable as the nearest stronghold can never be access with the border restrictions.

## Build
If you want to contribute to the project or build from breaking changes, you can clone the repository and build the project with Maven using the following command:
```
mvn clean package
```
